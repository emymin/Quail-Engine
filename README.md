# Quail-Engine
Quail is a small 3D OpenGL engine written in C++

It features:

- A scene system with transform hierarchy, cameras and point lights
- A material system with dynamic material properties
- Standard shader with diffuse and specular lighting
- OpenVR support

This is meant to be more of a learning project than a practical engine to make games in
